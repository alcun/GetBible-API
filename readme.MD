A python script to interact with getbible API #https://getbible.net/api.

Queries user for input and returns values from JSON data.

Idea from Brandon Jacobson with some changes made such as version and input queries.

This app is for personal reference as a blueprint to further work with APIs.


CURRENT VERSION:
- Two available functions, one for specific verse and one for the whole chapter (comment out the one to use)
-Some traceback errors run on cmd shell

TO DO:
