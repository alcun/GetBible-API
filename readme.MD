A python script to interact with getbible API #https://getbible.net/api.
Uses requests and JSON (pip install if needed).

- Queries user for input and returns values from JSON data.

- Idea from Brandon Jacobson with changes made such as version and input queries.

- This is for personal reference as a blueprint to further work with APIs.


CURRENT VERSION:
- Two available functions, one for specific verse and one for the whole chapter (comment out the one to use)
- Some traceback errors run on cmd shell

TO DO:

- List available books, verses and chapters if users asks at query 

- Let the user choose version 

- Export as text doc 

- Put on a webapp with gui, run on android

- Add a random feature 

- Save favourite verses to database / share
